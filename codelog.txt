Starting day solving the issue with env variable API_PORT
^^ Problem solved with npm package 'dotenv'
Up next will be the research if ECMA style of import can be done without specifying file type
^^ It is possible using Babel. Decided to not go that way and specify file types when needed.
--all issues from D-1 solved, no issues pending
Continuing basic structure development with use of https://medium.com/swlh/socket-io-games-the-right-way-using-nodejs-and-react-not-a-chat-app-part-1-e7a49d2f3f51
Understanding Namespaces and Rooms, implementing roomManager
^^roomManager as described in the tutorial won't be necessary
Proceeding with implementing basic FE

Trying the best way how to combine React FE with Node Express BE, let's go with https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-react-frontend-a-node-express-backend-and-connect-them-together-c5798926047c/
^^ that was disproved as outdated tutorial
Continuing with official Socket.io tutorial https://socket.io/docs/v3/server-installation/
^^ unfortunately socket.io documentation is not very well written.
Next try using https://medium.com/swlh/socket-io-games-the-right-way-using-nodejs-and-react-not-a-chat-app-part-1-e7a49d2f3f51
End of the session: Node server is running without errors. Issues to solve - using literal references with file type; API_PORT in app.js on server side is hardcoded, should be defined by .env
