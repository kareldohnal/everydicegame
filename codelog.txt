Continuing with building testing form for namespace and room creation.
Form done, now implementing proper response from server.
I drop the idea of separate namespaces for separate games. It is unnecessary complication as the game type can be passed as room variable. Focusing on rooms only.
End of the session: Pending problem - Socket connecting twice on server and.

Starting with pending problem from last session.
^^solved. At this point the differentiation for prod/dev is not solved, but that can be skipped for now as I don't have deployed prod env
Next up we will try to create separate rooms in Socket.io
End of the session: Implementing FE form for basic room creation. Continue with that.

Starting day solving the issue with env variable API_PORT
^^ Problem solved with npm package 'dotenv'
Up next will be the research if ECMA style of import can be done without specifying file type
^^ It is possible using Babel. Decided to not go that way and specify file types when needed.
--all issues from D-1 solved, no issues pending
Continuing basic structure development with use of https://medium.com/swlh/socket-io-games-the-right-way-using-nodejs-and-react-not-a-chat-app-part-1-e7a49d2f3f51
Understanding Namespaces and Rooms, implementing roomManager
^^roomManager as described in the tutorial won't be necessary
Proceeding with implementing basic FE
Basic React FE implemented
End of the session: Basic FE and BE seem to run ok. Pending issues - FE io ENDPOINT is hardcoded - transfer to .env and distinguish between production and dev

Trying the best way how to combine React FE with Node Express BE, let's go with https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-react-frontend-a-node-express-backend-and-connect-them-together-c5798926047c/
^^ that was disproved as outdated tutorial
Continuing with official Socket.io tutorial https://socket.io/docs/v3/server-installation/
^^ unfortunately socket.io documentation is not very well written.
Next try using https://medium.com/swlh/socket-io-games-the-right-way-using-nodejs-and-react-not-a-chat-app-part-1-e7a49d2f3f51
End of the session: Node server is running without errors. Issues to solve - using literal references with file type; API_PORT in app.js on server side is hardcoded, should be defined by .env
